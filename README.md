# Web Foundations: FreshDeals

## Description

- In this repositiory, I followed a prompt:

- You should see a site for buying groceries. The currently selected product is “Organic Blueberries”. If you landed on this page, you may have some questions.

- Can I buy anything besides blueberries?

- Is everything on this site organic or can I buy conventional produce?

- Does this site offer non-produce items?

- By adding breadcrumbs to this site, you will be adding a UI element that hints to some of the questions above. By doing so, users will have a better feeling for what the site provides and the optional attributes of the product they are purchasing.

- We are focused on the layout of this page and will be implementing the breadcrumbs via HTML and CSS. The links to the breadcrumbs will not function.
